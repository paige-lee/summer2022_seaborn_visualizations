# summer2022_seaborn_visualizations

This summer, I wanted to improve my visualization skills in Python using Seaborn. I found two Kaggle datasets that I found interesting and made visualizations to better understand the data. The first dataset was about data science salaries. The second dataset was about U.S. shootings from 2018-2022.
